# Social Progress Index – PCA and Factor Analysis (MATLAB)

This repository contains author's student project focused on the **Social Progress Index (SPI)** dataset for 2016, analyzing data from 162 countries. The analysis includes:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Scree plot and eigenvalue interpretation
- Factor analysis using varimax rotation
- Interpretation of factor structure and factor scores
- Identification of groups of countries by social development

> ⚠️ Please note: The code and final report are written in **Czech**, as this was submitted as a university course project at Mendel University in Brno, Czech Republic.

## Project Structure
- `projekt2.mlx`: MATLAB Live Script with all code and graphs
- `drabkova_projekt2.pdf`: Final PDF report including theory, visualizations, and interpretation

## About the Data
The dataset contains 40 standardized indicators covering:
- Basic human needs (e.g. access to electricity, child mortality)
- Foundations of well-being (e.g. education, health care)
- Opportunity (e.g. civil liberties, political rights)

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted using MATLAB and includes:
- Data cleaning and standardization
- Outlier detection using Hotelling’s T² statistic
- PCA and selection of relevant components
- Varimax-rotated factor analysis and interpretation of loadings
- Biplots and clustering of countries
